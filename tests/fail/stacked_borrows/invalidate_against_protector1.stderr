error: Undefined Behavior: not granting access to tag <TAG> because incompatible item [Unique for <TAG>] is protected by call ID

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Stacked Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/stacked-borrows.md for further information
help: <TAG> was created by a SharedReadWrite retag at offsets [0x0..0x4]

help: <TAG> cannot be used for memory access because that would remove protected tag <TAG>, protected by this function call
