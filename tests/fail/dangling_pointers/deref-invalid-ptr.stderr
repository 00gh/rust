warning: pointer-to-integer cast

LL |     let x = 16usize as *const u32;
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ pointer-to-integer cast
   |
   = help: this program is using integer-to-pointer casts or (equivalently) `from_exposed_addr`,
   = help: which means that Miri might miss pointer bugs in this program
   = help: see https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ptr/fn.from_exposed_addr.html for more details on that operation
   = help: to ensure that Miri does not miss bugs in your program, use `with_addr` (https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ptr/index.html#strict-provenance) instead
   = help: you can then pass the `-Zmiri-strict-provenance` flag to Miri, to ensure you are not relying on `from_exposed_addr` semantics
   = help: alternatively, the `-Zmiri-permissive-provenance` flag disables this warning
