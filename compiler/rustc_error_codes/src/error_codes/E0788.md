A `#[no_coverage]` attribute was incorrectly placed on something that couldn't
be covered.

Example of erroneous code:

```compile_fail,E0788
#[no_coverage]
struct Foo;

#[no_coverage]
const FOO: Foo = Foo;
```

`#[no_coverage]` tells the compiler to not generate coverage instrumentation for
a piece of code when the `-C instrument-coverage` flag is passed. Things like
structs and consts are not coverable code, and thus cannot do anything with this
attribute.

If you wish to apply this attribute to all methods in an impl or module,
manually annotate each method; it is not possible to annotate the entire impl
with a `#[no_coverage]` attribute.
