error[E0277]: the trait bound `&'static B: From<&A>` is not satisfied

LL |     (a, a)
   |         ^ the trait `From<&A>` is not implemented for `&'static B`

   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Into<&'static B>` for `&A`
help: consider introducing a `where` bound, but there might be an alternative better way to express this requirement
