   |     ----------------   ^^^^^ expected struct `Rc`, found `bool`

   |     expected due to the type of this binding

   = note: expected struct `Rc<RefCell<bool>>`
                found type `bool`
note: there are multiple methods with the same name, `borrow_mut` refers to `std::borrow::BorrowMut::borrow_mut` in the method call

LL |     *rc.borrow_mut() = false;

help: you might have meant to invoke a different method, you can use the fully-qualified path
