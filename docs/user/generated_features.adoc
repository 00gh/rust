=== Extend Selection
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/extend_selection.rs[extend_selection.rs]


Extends the current selection to the encompassing syntactic construct
(expression, statement, item, module, etc). It works with multiple cursors.

=== File Structure
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/display/structure.rs[structure.rs]


Provides a tree of the symbols defined in the file. Can be used to

* fuzzy search symbol in a file (super useful)
* draw breadcrumbs to describe the context around the cursor
* draw outline of the file

=== Go to Implementation
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/goto_implementation.rs[goto_implementation.rs]


Navigates to the impl block of structs, enums or traits. Also implemented as a code lens.

=== On Typing Assists
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/typing.rs[typing.rs]


Some features trigger on typing certain characters:

- typing `let =` tries to smartly add `;` if `=` is followed by an existing expression
- Enter inside comments automatically inserts `///`
- typing `.` in a chain method call auto-indents


=== Run
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/runnables.rs[runnables.rs]


Shows a popup suggesting to run a test/benchmark/binary **at the current cursor
location**. Super useful for repeatedly running just a single test. Do bind this
to a shortcut!

=== Workspace Symbol
**Source:** https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide_db/src/symbol_index.rs[symbol_index.rs]


Uses fuzzy-search to find types, modules and functions by name across your
project and dependencies. This is **the** most useful feature, which improves code
navigation tremendously. It mostly works on top of the built-in LSP
functionality, however `#` and `*` symbols can be used to narrow down the
search. Specifically,

- `Foo` searches for `Foo` type in the current workspace
- `foo#` searches for `foo` function in the current workspace
- `Foo*` searches for `Foo` type among dependencies, including `stdlib`
- `foo#*` searches for `foo` function among dependencies

That is, `#` switches from "types" to all symbols, `*` switches from the current
workspace to dependencies.
